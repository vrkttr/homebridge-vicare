# Homebridge ViCare Plugin

The Homebridge ViCare Plugin allows you to integrate your Viessmann ViCare heating system with Homebridge, enabling control and monitoring through Apple's HomeKit. This plugin provides real-time temperature readings, control over target temperatures, and access to various sensors and states of your heating system.

This version was written by [@ffflorian](https://github.com/ffflorian), thank you very much!

## Features

- Current temperature display
- Target temperature control
- Integration with various heating system sensors (burner state, water temperature, etc.)
- Easy configuration through Homebridge

Enhance your smart home setup by seamlessly connecting your Viessmann ViCare system with HomeKit.

## API Key

To use this plugin, you will need to create an API key by following these steps:

1. **Create an Account**: Sign up for an account on the [Viessmann Developer Portal](https://app.developer.viessmann-climatesolutions.com/).

2. **Create a new client:**
   - Log in to the Viessmann Developer Portal.
   - Navigate to "Clients" and create a new client.
   - Wait a few minutes for the client to be registered.

3. **Redirect URI Configuration:**
   - Set the Redirect URI in the Developer Portal to `http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:4200`. Replace `YOUR_LOCAL_IP` with the local IP address of the machine running Homebridge.

4. **Update your Homebridge config.json:**
   - Copy the `client_id` from your registered client in the Developer Portal.
   - Update your `config.json` with the `client_id`:
   - Optional: add your host IP manually
   - Optional: add the device type to appear as a temperature sensor or thermostat (temperature change currently not supported)

## Config

```json5
{
  platforms: [
    {
      platform: 'ViCareThermostatPlatform',
      name: 'ViCareThermostat',
      clientId: 'YOUR CLIENT ID',
      apiEndpoint: 'https://api.viessmann-climatesolutions.com/iot/v1',
      hostIp: 'YOUR HOST IP', // optional, default is the detected IP address
      devices: [
        {
          name: 'Supply temperature',
          feature: 'heating.circuits.0.sensors.temperature.supply',
          deviceId: '0',
          type: 'temperature_sensor', // optional
        },
        {
          name: 'Main DHW temperature',
          feature: 'heating.dhw.temperature.main',
          deviceId: '0',
          maxTemp: 38, // optional
          type: 'thermostat', // optional, default is "temperature_sensor"
        },
      ],
    },
  ],
}
```

## Authentication Process

The plugin will handle the OAuth2 authentication process automatically. Follow these steps:

1. Start Homebridge. The plugin will log a URL for authentication.
2. Open the URL in your browser. You will be prompted to log in to your Viessmann account and authorize the application.
3. After successful login, you will be redirected to the Redirect URI you configured. The plugin will automatically capture the authorization code and exchange it for an access token.
